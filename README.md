Avoided Crossing/Coupled Oscillators

Includes 4 files: avoided_crossing_slider.R, avoided_crossing.R, oscillator_slider.R, and oscillator.R

avoided_crossing_slider.R and avoided_crossing.R model the physics phenomenon known as avoided crossing. While avoided_crossing.R
simply plots the data, avoided_crossing_slider.R creates a web application that includes a interactive slider used to adjust a coupling
value.

oscillator_slider.R and oscillator.R model the frequencies of the carts that were used in the classical representation of
avoided crossing. Likewise as before, oscillator_slider.R creates a web application that includes interactive sliders used to adjust
spring constants and cart masses.
